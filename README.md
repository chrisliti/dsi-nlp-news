This repo is for hosting shared code and documents for the NLP project of DSI program 2022

## Introduction  
This repository details the work done by Scoop finders (Team C) for the [Africa Data Science Intensive (DSI) program](http://dsi-program.com/) Module 3 task. The goal of the task was to come up with an interesting natural language processing (NLP) project using either audio, text or both. 

We chose to create an app that provides an overview of one week of current twitter data. We chose to focus on tweets from Kenya, but this can easily be customised for another country or region. Our app is aimed at individuals working in the media industry who would like to supplement information gained from traditional media sources with information about currently treading topics on social media. In this way they would be able to better tailor their content to topics that are currently popular or trending. Our app also provides information on the sentiment and subjectively of the tweets as well as a text generation component that is intended to be used to provide background information or introduction. We have also allowed the user to adjust the date range so that they can analysis tweeter data, for example, on a specific date or over a weekend.
